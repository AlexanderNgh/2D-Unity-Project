C# Scripts for Unity Project

Unity is a popular game engine for both Desktop applications as well as mobile applications. 

This repo contains several scripts that I developed for a personal project of mine in which I utilized Unity's game engine and library. In the files provided, different scripts provided different functionalities to the game. I attempted to make the scripts as reuseable as possible, for example, a scene management script that I was able to utilize for every scene change within the game. 

Another script would be the player_controller script. This mainly dealt with movement within the game. Additional functionality included making sure that the player remained within the game throughout scene changes and handling that type of event. 

The dialogue_controller and movement_controller scripts dealt with NPC's or character objects within the game. These scripts allowed for the player to engage in dialogue with the objects in the game as well as providing a sense of async movement for the NPC. By providing the amount of time and parameters on the location of the NPC, the script is able to handle the NPC moving within the scene. The dialogue script also handled UI management from the Unity library, allowing for a seamless and good user experience in the game!
